                    Blood donation is a voluntary procedure that can help save the lives of others. There are several types of blood donation. Each type helps meet different medical needs.

                    This is the most common type of blood donation, during which you donate about a pint (about half a liter) of whole blood. The blood is then separated into its components â€” red cells, plasma and sometimes platelets.
